 1) Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

CODE:
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        c=s.reverse()
        print (c)
        
 
 2)  Given a 3-digit number, you have to reverse the number.

Input Format
A single line containing a 3 digit number n.

Output Format
The number generated by reversing the digits.

Examples
Sample Input 1
237
Expected Output
732
CODE:
# Write your code here
n=int(input())
sum=0
while(n>0):
	r=n%10
	sum=sum*10+r
	n=n//10
print(sum)
